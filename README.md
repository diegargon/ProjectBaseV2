Rewrite ProjectBase



ProjectBase V2
===========

That the second big rewrite of ProjectBase

I started this project for learn how to build something like a CMS from scratch, with plugins support, and other things for learning
more deeply PHP.

This code are in very early stage, have bugs, security problems and messy code. This code can change completely and probably will change. 

EXAMPLE SITE
============
Early example XXXX (sometimes not work since its the production web)

BUGS
=========

Cyclic problem, Blocks need session (later use) but sessions need frontend and frontend blocks, works if we remove sessions as depend of blocks.
and many other...
